![Alt ou t√≠tulo da imagem](https://snapstack.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ToolsForBuildingApps_636x300-op.png)

> The main goal of this study to ensure the quality of an Android mobile application from cases of manual and automated tests.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Test project for the App Loja developed in [Julio de Lima Software Quality and Testing Program](https://mentoria.juliodelima.com.br/). 

The app has:
1. Login screen
2. Screen for products list
3. Screen for adding products 
4. Screen for adding components to a product.

Features:
1. Adding new products with or without components
2. Exclude products
3. Edit products
4. Leave the shop.

## üöß Adjustments and improvements

The study is still under development and the next updates will focus on the following tasks:

1. - [x] Visual Regression Tests
3. - [x] Exploit Tests and validate APP requests to a REST API
4. - [x] Create the first test case that will be automated based on a business rule
5. - [x] Automate the created test case
6. - [ ] Create test cases that cover all business rules 
7. - [ ] Automate all test cases
8. - [ ] Translation of the project to English

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the tests
### üó∫Ô∏è Exploratory Tests
  There is an official Android guide that shows the main quality criteria for an Android app. See [here](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/fundamentals?hl=pt-br).  
From this guide and studies I followed some key points for the exploratory tests:  

##### üëæTests related to Android system
  - Rotation: Rotate the device on various screens
  - Permission: What happens if permissions are not given to the app?
  - Airplane mode: Use the app in airplane mode and put the device in airplane mode while using the app.
  - Interruptions: How does the app work when you receive a notification or connection?
  - Connections: How does the app behave on slow connections? If you switch from wi-fi to mobile data does the app still work? If you change the language the currency changes?

#### üìàTests related to business rules
- [x] Execute business rules
- [x] Continuity of flows
- [x] Listing of many records
- [x] Masks, enabling/disabling and typing fields
- [x] Network variation
- [x] API integration
- [x] Loss of focus of the Application

#### üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èValidate APP requests to a REST API
- Requirements:
  James Proxy and Genymotion
  
- Steps:
  1. Open the James Proxy and take the port
  2. Open the terminal and take the local ip
  3. Genymotion: Configure the proxy on the device
  4. Interact with the App and view requests in James Proxy

### üõ†Ô∏èCreate the first test case that will be automated based on a business rule
Among the business rules is that:
```
"It is only possible to add a product that the value is between R$0.01 and R$ 7,000.00"
```
So based on the  **Gherkin** model we have:  
```
Given the app store installed on the device  
And the user accesses the login page  
And fill in your valid credentials  
And triggers the login option  
When you press the "+" button to add a product  
And fill with name and value above $ 7,000.00  
Then an error alert is displayed.  
```

### üë®‚Äçüíª Automated Test
JUnit and Appium libraries were used together with Selenium Webdriver. The rule for the documentation used was #PageObjects 

~~~java
@DisplayName("Validacao do valor de produto n√£o permitido")
    @Test
    public void testValidacaoDoValorNaoPermitido() {
        //Fazer login
        String mensagemApresentada = new LoginTela(app)
                .preencherUsuario("admin")
                .preencherSenha("admin")
                .submeterLogin()
                .abrirTelaAdicaoProduto()
                .preencherNomeProduto("Iphone")
                .preencherValorProduto("7001")
                .preencherCoresProduto("Preto,Branco")
                .submissaoComErro()
                .obterMensagemDeErro();

        //Validar a mensagem de erro
        Assertions.assertEquals("O Valor do Produto deve estar entre R$0,01 e R$7.000,00",mensagemApresentada);
    }

).

## üî© Results:
### API requests
```
When the login is done is sent the 3 requests of type GET equal, we could talk to the development team to decrease to one and
decreasing the login time of the usual that if we thought on a scale of thousands users could make a difference.
```
### Exploratory Tests
* Loss of focus of the Application

```
Steps:
Given the fabric adding products
And the usual is filling in the name
When a notification arrives
And the user answers the notification
Then back to continue the action in the app

Result experienced:
The app flow continues to work.

Current Result:
The app closes and the device‚Äôs home screen is displayed.
